    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    Hello, I am a upcoming Junior at the Univeristy of Georgia. I am currently pursing<br/> 
    a major in Computer Science and intend on graduating with an emphasis in AI development<br/>
    as well as a Masters in Computer Science. Some activities I really enjoy are baseball, hunting, and fishing.<br>
    I grew up in Cumming, GA and immediatly embraced nature as a kid so the outdoors are a big part of my life.

    <h2>Work Experience </h2>

        <li>TFS IDS Backend Developer/API Development</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Toyota North America (May 2023 - Present)</li>
            <ul>
                <li>As a Backend API Development Intern, I am currently engaged in<br>
                    designing and developing efficient APIs to enhance operational processes<br>
                    within my Toyota family. With a focus on streamlining workflows and optimizing data management, I have successfully implemented several APIs that extract/put<br>
                    and manipulate data from/into databases.</li>
                <li>I also was able to work on a documentation assignment. I collected data('fields')<br>
                     and sorted and organized them on a unified documentation for not only MFS, but TMNA<br> as well. This allows them to be more efficent when accessing data and <br>thus helps them with their buisness. This in return helps TFS because MFS and TMNA are under TFS.
